# python has two types of loops

# 1-while loop
# 2-for loop

# while loop
# i=1
# while i <= 6:
#     print(i)
#     i=i+1

# break
# x=1
# while x<=6:
#     print("Value of x", x)
#     if x == 3:
#         break
#     x+=1

# continue statement
# x=1
# while x < 10:
#     x+=1
#     if x==5:
#         continue
#     print(x)

#  else Statement for while loop
